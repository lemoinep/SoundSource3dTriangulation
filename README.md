This program performs 3D localization of a sound source using an array of three microphones. 
The script can either generate synthetic test signals or work with existing audio recordings from the microphones. 
It optionally applies a bandpass filter for noise reduction, computes the time differences of arrival (TDOA) between the signals,
 and estimates the 3D position of the sound source. Additionally, the program calculates and outputs the elevation (θ) and azimuth (φ) angles 
 of the sound source with respect to the microphone plane, providing a full spherical direction indication.
